Newest version on dropbox:
Has a Timer
Has Pause Functionality
Tracks Score
Tracks Level (Score 0-2 = Level 1 | Score 3-4 =Level 2 | Score > 4=Level 3)
Tracks Lives

Needs:
A way to send messages to Android for which minigame is chosen
A way to wait until Android loads minigame to start minigame
A way to recognize when Android tells me to pause

That is all I think. And if we find a way to send Score to a database after every game, we can keep Hi Scores.

How to Run it:
Download "HTML Javascript Side" folder from dropbox
Unzip it wherever
Open pigparty3.html in chrome
Click up on the arrow key to simulate Android connection to the socket
Click down arrow during mini-game to simulate Android telling server to pause
